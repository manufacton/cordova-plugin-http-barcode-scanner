# cordova-plugin-http-barcode-scanner

## Supported Platforms
- iOS (7+)
- Android (API 21+)

The plugin provides the functionality of scanning barcodes (right now only QR on iOS) without leaving the user's application context. You can read the camera feed from the minimal internal HTTP server, show it as an 'embedded' video/photo feed, while scanning for codes.
